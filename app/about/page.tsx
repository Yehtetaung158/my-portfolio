        <p>
          Hey, my name is Charles Bruyerre and I use Sharlee as my nickname
          across social medias. I’m a graphic designer, UX/UI designer &
          front-end web developer from France. I’m also passionate about pop
          music and make portraits and universes around what I listen to and I’m
          always curious to learn more when it comes to new technologies and
          creative coding.
